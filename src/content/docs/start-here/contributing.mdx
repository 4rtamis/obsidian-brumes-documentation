I first created this theme for my personal use of Obsidian when designing City
of Mist cases. Some parts of the theme are poorly designed and I believe there
are many ways to improve the foundation I developed.

If you would like to propose new features, improvements, corrections, support
for plugins or report a bug, do not hesitate to open a pull request.

If you have any questions, you will likely find some help on the
[City of Mist RPG Discord](https://discord.gg/jH686wH) (tag **@4rtamis** in the
appropriate channel, for instance).

## Setup

In order to start working on this theme, create a fork of it and clone it on
your computer. Please use new branches for contributions.

You will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) (and npm) to install the packages
and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) (and gem) to install the sass compiler I
use.

The first time you open the project, you can use the following setup if you are
on Linux. You should be able to adapt it easily for other OS (like Windows).

```bash
sudo gem install sass
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Then, open a terminal inside the root directory of the project and run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Workflow

Create an Obsidian vault to live-test your modifications. Optionally, you can
use the
[one provided in the repository](https://github.com/4rtamis/obsidian-brumes/tree/master/demo).
Then, copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`. Change the OBSIDIAN_PATH
value to the path of your test vault theme folder (the path should end with
`/.obsidian/themes/`)

Open a terminal and type:

```bash
grunt
```

This will start a [GruntJS](https://gruntjs.com/) task runner that will
automatically compile when saving any CSS or SCSS file from the `src` directory.
It creates two files: `theme.css`, which is the distribution file, and
`Brumes.css`, which is an unminified copy of the theme.

## Submit your changes

Once you are happy with your work, you can submit it to the original Brumes
project using a pull request. Please be specific in your commit messages,
especially while doing the pull request. Use multiline commit messages when
needed.

:::caution

Be careful of licenses when adding assets to the theme. Fonts and images need to
be embedded in the CSS using Base64, but that does not change the fact that most
assets are probably under some license. Some licenses (like MIT) need to appear
in the final CSS theme. You can use
[`license.css`](https://github.com/4rtamis/obsidian-brumes/tree/master/src/css/license.css)
to add them to the project.
