Wether you're already familiar with Obsidian or not, start using Brumes in a few
minutes using the [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start). If you already have some
experience with Obsidian, you can also check out the
[Manual Installation Guide](#manual-installation) for a more customizable
experience.

#### Prerequisites

- **Obsidian 1.4.0 or higher**: you can download Obsidian from the
  [official website](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Download+and+install+Obsidian),
- and that's it!

:::note

Brumes embeds all the needed assets and fonts. However, the **Rift Bold** font
used in the official City of Mist books is not under a license compatible with
open source projects. In this theme, **Rift Bold** is replaced with **Bebas
Kai**. If you want to use **Rift Bold** nonetheless, you need to install it on
your system separately (follow this
[link](https://www.dafontfree.co/rift-font-family-free/)). Brumes will
automatically detect **Rift** and use it instead of the embedded font.

## Quick Start

#### Download Brumes boilerplate vault

Brumes comes with a boilerplate vault which is basically a small functionnal
template with everything you need to use Obsidian with Brumes directly out of
the box.

<LinkCard

:::caution

You may want to check that you have downloaded the official Brumes boilerplate
vault. For security purposes, here is the SHA256 checksum of the latest release
of the archive.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    <ol>
      <li>Go to the folder where you have downloaded `brumes-boilerplate-vault.zip`</li>
      <li>Right-click in an empty space in the file explorer</li>
      <li>Click on **Open in Windows Terminal**</li>
      <li>
        Paste the following command in the terminal window:
        <Code code={`CertUtil -hashfile "./brumes-boilerplate-vault.zip" SHA256 | findstr /v "hash" | findstr "${BOILERPLATE_HASH}" && echo Checksum validated successfully || echo Checksum validation failed`} lang="cmd" />
      </li>
    </ol>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux">
    Move to the directory where you have downloaded `brumes-boilerplate-vault.zip` and run the following command in a shell:
    <Code code={`echo "${BOILERPLATE_HASH}  brumes-boilerplate-vault.zip" | sha256sum -c --status && echo "Checksum validated successfully" || echo "Checksum validation failed"
`} lang="bash" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Mac">
    Open the terminal, go to the directory where you have downloaded `brumes-boilerplate-vault.zip` (using the `cd` command), and run the following command:
    <Code code={`echo "${BOILERPLATE_HASH}  brumes-boilerplate-vault.zip" | shasum -a 256 -c && echo "Checksum validated successfully" || echo "Checksum validation failed"
`} lang="bash" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Extract the archive

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    <ol>
      <li>Right-click the folder</li>
      <li>Select **Extract All**</li>
      <li>Select a destination folder where to extract the files</li>
      <li>Click **Extract**</li>
    </ol>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux">
    You can simply run the `unzip` command:

    ```bash

    unzip brumes-boilerplate-vault.zip -d /path/to/directory

    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Mac">
    Simply double-click on the archive and it will extract it in the same folder.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The folder `Brumes Boilerplate Vault` contains the whole vault, with all the
template notes and Brumes already configured : move it wherever you want in your
file system. You can then rename this folder with the name you want (ex. the
name of your crew or the name of your series).

#### Open the vault with Obsidian

Open Obsidian and from the startup window, click on the open button of the
**Open folder as vault** section, then select the Brumes boilerplate vault
folder (that you may have renamed) you've just extracted.

![Opening an exsiting folder as a vault in Obsidian](../../../assets/installation/obsidian_open_existing_folder.png)

Obsidian should display a warning and ask you if you want to "Trust the author
of this vault". This message pops-up because the vault already contains Brumes
and some community plugins for it to run effectively. Click on **Trust author
and enable plugins**.

![Trusting the author of an existing vault in Obsidian](../../../assets/installation/obsidian_trust_author.png)

#### Ready to go!

That's it! You can now play around with the boilerplate vault. Copy and paste
the blocks you want directly from the existing notes and start writing your next
case! If you want to get a more detailed overview of what Brumes can do, check
out our [Feature Guide](/features).

## Manual Installation

This section is split into two:

1.  Installation of Brumes as an Obsidian theme
2.  Installation of Brumes required companion plugins

### Theme Installation

Brumes can be installed either in a whole new vault or in an existing one. Skip
the first step if you already have an existing vault.

#### Create a new Obsidian vault (Optional)

Launch Obsidian and create a new vault from the startup window.

![Creating a new vault with Obsidian](../../../assets/installation/obsidian_create_new_vault.png)

#### Find the `.obsidian` folder in your vault

In your file explorer, find the root folder of the vault in which you want to
install Brumes (ex. the folder you selected when you created the vault). In this
folder, you should see another folder called `.obsidian`. If you do not see this
folder, follow the steps below:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    **Windows 11**: From the File Explorer, select **View** > **Show** > **Hidden items**.

    **Windows 10**: From the File Explorer, select **View** > **Options** > **Change folder and search options**. Then select the **View** tab and, in the **Advanced settings** section, select **Show hidden files, folders, and drives** before clicking on **OK**.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux">
    This is highly dependant on your desktop environment. Use preferably a shell and display hidden files and folders using `ls -la`.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Mac">
    In the Finder, press <KBD body="Ctrl" /> + <KBD body="Shift" /> + <KBD body="." /> to toggle the visibility of hidden files and folders.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Download and add Brumes to your vault

Download two files from the latest release of Brumes : `theme.css` and
`manifest.json`.

<LinkCard
  title="Latest Release"
  description="Click here to download the latest release of Brumes."
  href="https://github.com/4rtamis/obsidian-brumes/releases"
/>

Then go back to your vault folder.

1. Create a new `themes` folder inside the `.obsidian` folder.
2. Create a new `Brumes` folder inside the `themes` folder.

Then move `theme.css` and `manifest.json` inside the newly created `Brumes`
folder. Your vault structure should look like this now:

```txt {3-6}

Your vault name/
├── .obsidian/
│   └── themes/
│       └── Brumes/
│           ├── manifest.json
│           └── theme.css
└── [...]

```

#### Select Brumes in Obsidian settings

1. Back in Obsidian, click on the little cog wheel at the bottom left-hand
   corner of the interface to open the settings window.
2. Go to the **Appearance** tab.
3. Select Brumes in the **Themes** section.

![Selecting Brumes as theme in Obsidian](../../../assets/installation/obsidian_select_theme_in_interface.png)

### Companion Plugins Installation

The following plugins should be installed alongside Brumes:

- [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) is a community plugin
  that defines a powerful templating language right inside Obsidian. It is used
  to facilitate the creation of **dangers**, **tags**, **statuses** and
  **spectrums**.
- [Canvas CSS Class](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/obsidian-canvas-css-class)
  is a community plugin that can add CSS classes to canvas. It is especially
  useful to create **Icebergs**.

#### Templater

You can install Templater via the Community Plugins tab within Obsidian.

Go to **Settings** > **Community plugins** > **Browse** (you might need to turn
off "Restricted mode"). Simply search for "Templater" and install it. Do not
forget to enable the plugin once installed.

![Enabling Templater in Obsidian settings](../../../assets/installation/obsidian_enable_templater.png)

Then, in your note tree directly in Obsidian, create an empty folder called
"Templates" (or any name that seems appropriate). This folder will contain all
the templates you will add in order to facilitate the creation of _tags_,
_status_, _dangers_...

Open once more the settings window and go to the **Templater** tag at the bottom
of the list. In the **Template folder location** section, select the folder
you've just created.

![Adding the templates folder to Templater](../../../assets/installation/obsidian_add_templates_folder.png)

:::caution

If you ever move, rename or delete this folder, Templater will not be able to
locate your templates anymore. You will need to indicate your new template
folder in the settings of Templater.

:::

#### Canvas CSS Class

You can install Canvas CSS Class via the Community Plugins tab within Obsidian.

Like before, go to **Settings** > **Community plugins** > **Browse**. Simply
search for "Canvas CSS Class" and install it. Do not forget to enable the plugin
once installed.

#### Ready to go!

That's it! You are now ready to start working using Brumes. If you want to get a
more detailed overview of what Brumes can do, check out our
[Feature Guide](/features).

<LinkCard
  title="Feature Guide"
  description="Click here to discover everything Brumes can do!"
  href="/features"
/>

:::caution

Please note that we only installed Templater. We did not create the templates
that enable you to quickly add _tags_, _status_, _dangers_ and so on... In order
to create these templates, please refer to the [Feature Guide](/features) or
check out the [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start) whose boilerplate vault contains
the base templates.
